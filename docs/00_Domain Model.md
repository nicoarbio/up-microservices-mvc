# Domain Model - Iteration 0
This document defines the core entities and their relationships for the car dealership system. The focus is on delivering a functional minimum with essential data modeling and clear service boundaries.

## Entities

- Branch: Represents a branch location in a specific city and country.
- VehicleModel: Represents a car model with year, price, warranty period
- VehicleUnit: Represents vehicles (available, sold, reserved) in specific Branch or Central deposit (are VehicleModel with plate)
- Customer: Represents a person who purchases vehicles or requests services.
- Sale: Represents a vehicle sale operation, awarding a stock item to a customer. The vehicle should be marked as sold.
- MaintenanceService: Represents a mechanical service request for a vehicle with or without available warranty.

### Notes
- A `Sale` links a `Customer`, `VehicleUnit`, and `Branch`.
- A Vehicle in `VehicleUnit` may exist in branch stock or central stock (depending on its locationType).
- A `MaintenanceService` is associated with a `Customer` and a `VehicleUnit`.
- Warranty eligibility is calculated based on the VehicleModel's warranty period and the Sale date, compared to the MaintenanceService entry date.
- When `VehicleUnit.status` is `EXTERNAL`, the vehicle was not sold nor stocked by the company. It exists only to support maintenance of external vehicles.
