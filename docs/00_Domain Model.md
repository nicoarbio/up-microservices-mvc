- A Vehicle in `Stock` may exist in branch stock or central stock (if c).
- A `MaintenanceService` is associated with a `Customer` and a `Vehicle`.
- `Warranty` eligibility is determined by comparing the sale date and vehicle warranty period with the service date.
- When `VehicleUnit.status` is `EXTERNAL`, the vehicle was not sold nor stocked by the company. It exists only to support maintenance of external vehicles.
